# HJ Alma Booster
A lightweight Chrome extension for boosting productivity in Alma

## Introduction
The HJ Alma Booster (Harvard Library Judaica Division Alma Booster Chrome Extension) was created—and
is in the process of further development—by Tom Wagg, Harvard '20, Littauer Judaica Library Student
Assistant, for the Harvard Library Judaica Division. It was built during the course of the Harvard
Judaica Division's implementation of the Alma library information system software, and was
subsequently shared with other Harvard Library units. This booster enables printing bibliographic
records from multiple points in Alma, reduces mouse-clicking, streamlines navigation to invoice and
receiving screens, and facilitates adding of Harvard local MARC fields to bibliographic and holding
records for statistics and special collections processing. The Harvard Library Judaica Division
welcomes collaboration with other Alma library installations to further develop this tool.

If you need more information on Chrome Extension development I recommend their guides and tutorials, the [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) is very thorough.

## Macro Express
The Chrome Extension often works in conjunction with Macro Express to write information to records. We have created another repository to hold the relevant Macro Express macros and this can be accessed [here](https://github.com/hl-judaica-division/hj-alma-booster-macro-express-helper)
