                    The HJ Alma Booster (Harvard Library Judaica Division Alma Booster Chrome Extension) was created—and
                    is in the process of further development—by Tom Wagg, Harvard '20, Littauer Judaica Library Student
                    Assistant, for the Harvard Library Judaica Division. It was built during the course of the Harvard
                    Judaica Division's implementation of the Alma library information system software, and was
                    subsequently shared with other Harvard Library units. This booster enables printing bibliographic
                    records from multiple points in Alma, reduces mouse-clicking, streamlines navigation to invoice and
                    receiving screens, and facilitates adding of Harvard local MARC fields to bibliographic and holding
                    records for statistics and special collections processing. The Harvard Library Judaica Division
                    welcomes collaboration with other Alma library installations to further develop this tool. </p>
                <p>
                    The code for the HJ Alma Booster can be found on GitHub
                    <a class="text-danger" href="https://github.com/hl-judaica-division/hj-alma-booster">here</a>. To add the current
                    version of the HJ Alma Booster to your Chrome profile, click <a class="text-danger" href="">TO BE ADDED</a> and contact
                    Elizabeth Vernon of the Harvard Library Judaica Division at juddiv@fas.harvard.edu for the password.

                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <p class="mb-1">Thank you for downloading the HJ Alma Booster. Let's get starting boosting your Alma
                    experience!
                    In order to open the popup you can either press <code>Alt+A</code> or click the red book icon in
                    the top right of chrome. Once you've opened up the menu you're presented with a list of different
                    Alma <span class="text-danger">boosters</span> as well as series of icons in the top panel. From
                    left to right the icons are;
                </p>
                <ul class="fa-ul mb-1">
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-question"></i></span>Help - Open this help page in a new
                        tab</li>
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cog"></i></span>Settings - Open the settings page in a new
                        tab</li>
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-times"></i></span>Close - Close the popup window</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    Now to navigate between boosters you can either use the mouse or keyboard. Each menu item is
                    clickable and will take you right to the page. In addition you can use the keyboard to navigate
                    the boosters. This can either be done with; <code>CTRL + arrow-key</code>, where arrow-key can
                    be either <i class="far fa-caret-square-up"></i> or <i class="far fa-caret-square-down"></i>, or
                    with <code>CTRL + #</code>, where # is the pane number you wish to open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to head into the settings and customise your experience. After that you're all set!
                    Open Alma in a new tab and then open the extension to try out our boosters! If you need help with
                    a specific booster just look below!

                <p>These scripts are found on the panes of the extension popup page which can be accessed by pressing
                    <code>Alt+A</code> or by pressing the red book icon</p>

                <p>
                    These boosters will appear on the relevant Alma page as red buttons, there is no need for input,
                    all information is gathered from the page so you only need to click the button.

                        pages as the red printing icon shown above. After clicking the button, the booster will find the
                        MMS ID on the page and then perform an API request for the record. The booster will then format
                        this XML record into a printout with up to two barcodes. There will always be a barcode in the
                        top left showing the MMS ID. Additionally, if there is a 035 field with an OCLC number that will
                        be place in a barcode in the upper right. This printout is then displayed with the user's
                        default chrome printing settings. If you wish to change the format or the fields that are in the
                        barcodes then your developers can make these changes easily.

                    <h4>Print Invoice</h4>
                    <p>
                        <span class="text-danger">Note: An API key with bibliographic read permissions is required for
                            this booster.</span><br> The print invoice booster will appear on Invoice Details page in
                        the invoice lines tab with the same icon as above. After clicking the button, the booster will
                        find the unique invoice identifier on the page and use that to pull up the invoice record with
                        an API request. From this record, the booster will loop over every PO line and find the MMS ID
                        attached to it. Then it will perform the Print Record booster on this MMS ID (see above) and
                        store the outputted printout. Finally, when all records are complete it will put them in invoice
                        order and print out the entire file. You can follow the progress of the booster with the loading
                        page that is created from the start.

                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            This extension works using a combination of user input through the popup and JavaScript
                            within Alma to speed up repetitive tasks. Any time that Alma loads (while this
                            extension is enabled), a series of scripts, styles and elements will be injected into Alma.
                            This means that we can add new buttons, functionality and specialised look to the
                            established system.<br /> When boosting tasks the extension has no more power than any human
                            user, it is simply a lot faster and will click buttons and fill out forms in the blink of an
                            eye. However, we hope to integrate with the Alma APIs as we develop in order to streamline
                            the process.

                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            The key point here is that the extension only has as much access as a normal user. The
                            loading screens will be just as long and the extension cannot increase the speed of
                            Alma.<br /> However, it can increase the speed that you <i>use</i> Alma and that is
                            where the magic happens!

                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            No! The files that we add to Alma on load are only a few megabytes in size, which is minimal
                            compared to what Alma is loading, you should notice no decrease in speed.
