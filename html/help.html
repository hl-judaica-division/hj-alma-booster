                <p class="mb-1">
                    The HJ Alma Booster (Harvard Library Judaica Division Alma Booster Chrome Extension) was created—and
                    is in the process of further development—by Tom Wagg, Harvard '20, Littauer Judaica Library Student
                    Assistant, for the Harvard Library Judaica Division. It was built during the course of the Harvard
                    Judaica Division's implementation of Ex Libris' Alma library information system software, and was
                    subsequently shared with other Harvard Library units. This booster enables printing bibliographic
                    records from multiple points in Alma, reduces mouse-clicking, streamlines navigation to invoice and
                    receiving screens, and facilitates adding of Harvard local MARC fields to bibliographic and holding
                    records for statistics and special collections processing. The Harvard Library Judaica Division
                    welcomes collaboration with other Alma library installations to further develop this tool. </p>
                <p>
                    The code for the HJ Alma Booster can be found on GitHub
                    <a class="text-danger" href="https://github.com/hl-judaica-division/hj-alma-booster">here</a>. To
                    add the current
                    version of the HJ Alma Booster to your Chrome profile, click <a class="text-danger" href="">TO BE
                        ADDED</a> and contact
                    Elizabeth Vernon of the Harvard Library Judaica Division at juddiv@fas.harvard.edu for the password
                    to activate the Chrome extension.

                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <p class="mb-1">Thank you for downloading the HJ Alma Booster. Let's get started boosting your Alma
                    experience! Boosters are accessed in one of two ways – via a pop-up in the address bar or via an
                    in-page icon.
                    In order to open the popup you can either press <code>Alt+A</code> or click the red
                    book icon in the top right of Chrome. Once you open the menu, you will be presented with a list
                    of different Alma <span class="text-danger">boosters</span> as well as series of icons in the
                    top panel. From left to right the icons are;
                </p>
                <ul class="fa-ul mb-1">
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-question"></i></span>Help - Open this Help page in a new
                        tab</li>
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-cog"></i></span>Settings - Open the Settings page in a new
                        tab</li>
                    <li><span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-times"></i></span>Close - Close the popup window</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    In order to navigate between boosters you can either use the mouse or keyboard. Each menu item is
                    clickable and will take you straight to the page. In addition you can use the keyboard to navigate
                    the boosters. This can either be done with; <code>CTRL + arrow-key</code>, where arrow-key can
                    be either <i class="far fa-caret-square-up"></i> or <i class="far fa-caret-square-down"></i>, or
                    with <code>CTRL + #</code>, where # is the pane number you wish to open.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feel free to head into the settings and customise your experience. After that you're all set!
                    Open Alma in a new tab and then open the extension to try out our boosters! If you need help with
                    a specific booster just look below.

                <p>
                    These boosters will appear on the relevant Alma page as red buttons, there is no need for input,
                    all information is gathered from the page so you only need to click the button.
                </p>

                        pages as the red printing icon shown above. After clicking the button, the booster will find the
                        MMS ID on the page and then perform an API request for the record. The booster will then format
                        this XML record into a printout with up to two barcodes. There will always be a barcode in the
                        top left showing the MMS ID. Additionally, if there is a 035 field with an OCLC number that will
                        be place in a barcode in the upper right. This printout is then displayed with the user's
                        default chrome printing settings. If you wish to change the format or the fields that are in the
                        barcodes then your developers can make these changes easily.

                    <h4>Print All Bibliographic Associated with Invoice</h4>

                            this booster.</span><br> The print invoice booster will appear on Invoice Details page in
                        the invoice lines tab with the same icon as above. After clicking the button, the booster will
                        find the unique invoice identifier on the page and use that to pull up the invoice record with
                        an API request. From this record, the booster will loop over every PO line and find the MMS ID
                        attached to it. Then it will perform the Print Record booster on this MMS ID (see above) and
                        store the outputted printout. Finally, when all records are complete it will put them in invoice
                        order and print out the entire file. You can follow the progress of the booster with the loading
                        page that is created from the start.

                            How does the extension work?
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            This extension works using a combination of user input through the popup and JavaScript
                            within Alma to speed up repetitive tasks. Any time that Alma loads (while this
                            extension is enabled), a series of scripts, styles and elements will be injected into Alma.
                            This means that we can add new buttons, functionality and other customisation.
                            <br /> When boosting tasks the extension currently has no more power than any human
                            user, it is simply a lot faster and will click buttons and fill out forms in the blink of an
                            eye. However, we hope to integrate Alma write APIs as we develop in order to streamline
                            work processes.

                            Why do I still see the Alma "spinning wheel" loading screens? This doesn't seem to have

                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            As mentioned above, the key point is that the extension only has as much access as a normal
                            user.
                            The extension cannot change Alma response time, however it <i>does</i> maximise your
                            efficient use of
                            Alma and that is where the magic happens!

                            Will this make loading Alma slower?
                        </div>
                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            No! The files that we add to Alma on load are only a few megabytes in size, which is minimal
                            compared to what Alma is loading, you should notice no decrease in speed.

                        <div class="qa-answer">
                            No, the password is only for installation. Users must still log into Alma using their Alma
                            password, and will have the same permissions that they always do. Boosters will not allow
                            you to do anything in Alma you weren’t already able to do!
